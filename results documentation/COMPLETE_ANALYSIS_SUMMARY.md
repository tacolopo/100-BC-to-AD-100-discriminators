## üî¢ Understanding Separation Scores

**Definition**: Separation score measures how effectively a feature distinguishes between authors.

**Formula**: `Separation Score = Minimum_Gap_Between_Authors / Total_Feature_Range`

**Interpretation**:
- **0.8-1.0**: Outstanding separation (our top features)
- **0.6-0.8**: Excellent separation  
- **0.4-0.6**: Good separation
- **0.2-0.4**: Moderate separation
- **0.0-0.2**: Poor separation

**Example**: Œ¥Œ≠ particle frequency
- Highest user: Bion of Phlossa (0.007166)
- Lowest user: Didymus Chalcenterus (0.000000)
- Range: 0.007166
- Smallest gap between any two authors: 0.000629
- Separation Score: 0.000629 √∑ 0.007166 = 0.8776

This means the smallest difference between any two authors is 87.76% of the total range, indicating excellent separation.

## üöÄ Extrapolation to Other Corpora

### **Required Data for Classification**

For each of our 60 discriminative features, we now have:

#### **1. Statistical Profiles**
- Mean, median, standard deviation across all authors
- Range (min/max values observed)
- Quartiles and percentiles for distribution analysis
- Outlier detection boundaries

#### **2. Author-Specific Values**
- Exact measurement for each of 33 authors
- Ranking (1st lowest to 33rd highest)
- Percentile position within the group
- Confidence indicators based on text length

#### **3. Feature Reliability Metrics**
- Separation score (discrimination power)
- Consistency within multi-text authors
- Genre stability assessment
- Recommended weighting for classification

### **Classification Methodology for Unknown Texts**

#### **Step 1: Feature Extraction**
```
Extract same 60 features from unknown text:
- Œ¥Œ≠ particle frequency = count(Œ¥Œ≠) / total_words
- Dative plural frequency = count(dative_plural_endings) / total_words
- [... all 60 features]
```

#### **Step 2: Distance Calculation**
```
For each feature:
distance = |unknown_value - author_value| / feature_range
weighted_distance = distance √ó separation_score
```

#### **Step 3: Author Similarity Scoring**
```
For each potential author:
similarity_score = 1 / (1 + sum(weighted_distances))
confidence = based on multiple feature agreement
```

#### **Step 4: Classification Decision**
- **High Confidence**: >85% similarity, multiple top features agree
- **Moderate Confidence**: 70-85% similarity, some top features agree  
- **Low Confidence**: 55-70% similarity, mixed evidence
- **Inconclusive**: <55% similarity, unclear attribution

### **Minimum Text Requirements**
- **Reliable Attribution**: 1,000+ words (our threshold)
- **Good Confidence**: 5,000+ words
- **High Confidence**: 10,000+ words  
- **Maximum Reliability**: 15,000+ words

**Rationale**: Feature frequencies stabilize with longer texts, reducing random variation.

### **Cross-Validation Approach**

#### **Internal Validation** (Recommended)
1. Split each author's texts into training (70%) and test (30%) sets
2. Train classifier on training portions
3. Test on held-out portions to measure accuracy
4. Expected accuracy: >95% for texts >5,000 words

#### **Temporal Validation**
- Test feature stability across different time periods
- Account for language evolution effects
- Adjust for historical linguistic changes

#### **Genre Validation** 
- Analyze genre effects on feature stability
- Create genre-specific adjustment factors
- Test cross-genre classification accuracy
